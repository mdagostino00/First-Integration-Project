"""
RPG Battle Sim for Integration Project
This was originally a fighting game themed project, but I thought it was
too limited in scope, so it's now an RPG themed project.
This is a script that plays like an autoclicker with RPG elements. It uses
python's tools to manage files, perform calculations, and present information
that show off what I learned about the language.
