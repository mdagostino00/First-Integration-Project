Integration Project for COP1500 Intro to Comp Sci

RPG Battle Sim for Integration Project
This was originally a fighting game themed project, but I thought it was
too limited in scope, so it's now an RPG themed project.
This is a script that plays like an autoclicker with RPG elements. It uses
Python's tools to manage files, perform calculations, and present information
in a fun game context that show off what I learned about Python
