# First-Integration-Project
Integration Project for COP1500 Intro to Comp Sci

RPG Battle Sim for Integration Project.
This was originally a fighting game themed project, but I thought it was
too limited in scope, so it's now an RPG themed project.
This is a script that plays like an autoclicker with RPG elements. It uses
Python's tools to manage files, perform calculations, and present information
in a fun game context that show off what I learned about Python.

I recommend running the file in it's own folder. While it doesn't touch any
of the files where it's in, it makes a \characterFiles directory in the
directory it's in, so it might help to run it in it's own folder.
